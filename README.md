How to Run
<insert steps>

## Workflow

make changes on your own branch and then merge into develop branch
periodically we will merge new versions of develop into master
DO NOT merge your personal branches into master

## File Setup
modularize as much as you can
DO NOT add a ton of crap to main.dart
All new features and pages should get their own dart files
